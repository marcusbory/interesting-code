Hash function given above is done via Linear Probing. It is not a good hash function because it simply generates a hash position via brute force linearly (ie index+1 while not empty bucket). This results in primary clustering, and the time taken to perform operations such as insert, delete, check exist may become O(N) eventually as elements with collision cluster together near the same base index, ruining the efficiency of a hash table.
